		<h3> History and characteristics<br></h3>
		
<p>		In 1966, Charlottetown Rural High School was built in the growing suburban community of West Royalty, north of the municipal limits of the city of Charlottetown.
		In 1994, The school was completely renovated to its present configuration which saw a new cafeteria and specialist instruction space added. The renovations saw the building's exterior and interior remodelled using a modern design of unusual angles and curves that symbolize waves which surround Prince Edward Island.
		The school is currently the largest in the province in terms of student enrollment and 2nd largest in terms of area. The high school offers both French and English language and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. </p>

		<h3 id="me">My experience in CRHS</h3>
		
		<p>Not going to lie if you want to come here to study you will feel disappointed.<br>
			The rural is a nice place to meet some new people or take some non-academic ctivities, but for academic no.<br> 
			You shall know CRHS is a relative smaller public school compare to others in larger provinces, so both the budget and resources are not very satisfying. The education curriculum was not setted to be challenging and you can feel you are not being pushed to pursue an academic achievement.<br>
			However, the school has a good sport spirit and there are multipule sport teams and interesting in-school clubs that help stdent to explore. And I would say, Most Teachers in the school are nice and glad to help students.</p>
